### **Firewalls**

- **Purpose**: Block or permit traffic based on predefined rules.
- **Operation**: Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.

### **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

- **Purpose**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats.
- **Types**:
    - **Network-based IDS (NIDS)**
    - **Host-based IDS (HIDS)**
- **Action**: Alerts administrators but doesn't block traffic.

### **Comparison**

- **Preventive vs. Detective**: Firewalls prevent, IDS detects.
- **Response**: Firewalls enforce policies, IDS provides alerts for manual response.
