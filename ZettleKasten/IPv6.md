### Overview

- **Format**: Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **Size**: 128-bit address space.
- **Total Addresses**: Approximately 3.4 x 10^38.

### Advantages

- **Vast Address Space**: Solves the problem of address exhaustion.
- **Improved Routing**: More efficient and hierarchical.
- **Built-in Security**: IPsec is mandatory in IPv6.
- **Simplified Configuration**: Supports auto-configuration of addresses.

### Zero Compression

- **Technique**: Simplifies the notation by compressing consecutive zeros.
- **Example**: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329` can be compressed to `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`.
