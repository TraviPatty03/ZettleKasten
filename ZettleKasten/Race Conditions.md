### Definition

A **Race Condition** occurs when the system's behavior depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events, leading to unpredictable results when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously.

### Key Features

- **Symptoms**:
    - Inconsistent or incorrect data.
    - Hard-to-reproduce bugs.
- **Causes**:
    - Lack of proper synchronization.
    - Concurrent access to shared variables.
- **Prevention**:
    - Implementing mutual exclusion.
    - Using synchronization primitives.
- **Detection**:
    - Code reviews.
    - Dynamic analysis tools.

### Personal Insight

Race conditions are among the most challenging bugs to identify and fix. Proper synchronization strategies are crucial to prevent them.
