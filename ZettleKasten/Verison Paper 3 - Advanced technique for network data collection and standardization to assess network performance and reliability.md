## Current Data Ingestion and Pipeline Framework

### Data Volume and Complexity

- **Data Scale**:
    - Approximately 149 TB of raw data for ECDS and 57 TB for MNI are collected daily.
    - Generates around 122 billion rows weekly, equating to roughly 1 petabyte of data.
- **Hierarchy of Data Flow**:
    - Data hierarchy includes regions, markets, eNodeBs (for LTE), sectors, and carriers.

### Existing Data Ingestion Process

- **Cron Job and Shell Scripts**:
    - A cron job runs every minute to execute a shell script that copies raw data files.
    - The process is synchronous, with only one copy process running at a time.
- **Data Loss Risks**:
    - Assumes the copy process completes within 10 minutes; if not, data may be lost.
    - No verification mechanism to ensure files are copied successfully.
- **Processing and Parsing**:
    - Copied files are split into smaller batches on physical servers.
    - Each record in the raw data files is converted into a Kafka message.
- **Infrastructure Limitations**:
    - Multiple physical machines are required to handle data from different regions.
    - Scalability is constrained by the physical infrastructure.

### Data Aggregation and Loading

- **Parsing and KPI Derivation**:
    - Kafka messages are parsed to derive KPIs.
- **Data Storage**:
    - KPI data is loaded into distributed data stores like Druid.
    - Aggregations are performed at minute, hourly, and daily intervals.
- **Complexity and Latency**:
    - Data aggregation and loading are handled within the data store processes, adding complexity.
    - A Redis cache layer is used to reduce latency for the user interface but adds another layer to maintain.

### Ingestion Process Redesign

- **Splitting the Ingestion Process**:
    
    - Divided into three independent, scalable processes:
        1. **File Discovery**: Finds raw data files and creates a Kafka message with file names.
        2. **File Copying**: Listens to Kafka messages and copies files, updating Cassandra for traceability.
        3. **File Feeding**: Opens copied files and creates Kafka messages for each record.
- **Traceability with Cassandra**:
    
    - Every copied file updates an entry in Cassandra for tracking and traceability.
- **Error Handling and Retries**:
    
    - If file copying fails, the process updates the status in Cassandra and retries to prevent data loss.

### Data Parsing and Aggregation

- **Parsing**:
    - Kafka messages containing raw data records are parsed to derive KPIs.
    - Data is split into independent records for 4G LTE and 5G services.

- **Schema Registry and Metadata Abstraction**:
    - Schema information is stored in a schema registry.
    - Aggregator uses schema metadata, making it adaptable to new datasets without code changes.

### Aggregator Process Breakdown

- **Five Sub-Steps**:
    
    1. **Pre-Aggregation Filtering**: Filters out irrelevant data before aggregation.
    2. **Pre-Aggregation Transformation**: Performs operations like adding columns.
    3. **Aggregation**: Aggregates data over defined time windows (tumbling or sliding).
    4. **Post-Aggregation Filtering**: Applies additional filters after aggregation.
    5. **Post-Aggregation Transformation**: Final data transformations before storage.
- **Time Windows**:
    
    - **Tumbling Window**: Non-overlapping, fixed-size time intervals (e.g., hourly).
    - **Sliding Window**: Overlapping windows that slide by a specified interval (e.g., every minute).

### Data Storage and Consumption
