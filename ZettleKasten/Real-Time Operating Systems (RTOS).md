### Definition

A **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** is an operating system designed to process data and events within strict time constraints, ensuring predictable and deterministic behavior.

### Key Features

- **Determinism**:
    - Guarantees tasks are executed within specified timing constraints.
- **Types**:
    - **Hard Real-Time Systems**:
        - Missing a deadline can lead to catastrophic failure.
    - **Soft Real-Time Systems**:
        - Deadlines are important but some delays are tolerable.
- **Synchronization Primitives in RTOS**:
    - **Mutexes** and **Semaphores** tailored for minimal latency.
    - Support for priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion.
- **Task Scheduling**:
    - Priority-based preemptive scheduling.
    - Ensures high-priority tasks meet deadlines.

### Personal Insight

RTOS environments demand careful synchronization to maintain real-time performance. Even small delays can have significant consequences.
