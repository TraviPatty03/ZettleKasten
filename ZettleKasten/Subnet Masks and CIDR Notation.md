### Subnet Masks

- **Function**: Determines which portion of the IP address is the network part and which is the host part.
- **Example**: `255.255.255.0` means the first three octets are the network portion.

### CIDR Notation

- **Classless Inter-Domain Routing** allows for more flexible IP address allocation.
- **Format**: `IP_address/prefix_length` (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
- **Prefix Length**: Indicates the number of bits in the network portion.

### Personal Insight

CIDR notation simplifies subnetting and is widely used in modern networking.
