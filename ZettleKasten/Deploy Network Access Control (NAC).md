Implementing policies to control devices' access to the network based on their compliance with security policies.

### **Ubuntu/Linux and Windows**

- **Implement NAC Solutions:**
    - Use products like **Cisco ISE**, **Aruba ClearPass**, or open-source **PacketFence**.
- **Set Access Policies:**
    - Define who or what devices can access the network and under what conditions.
- **Device Profiling:**
    - Automatically identify and classify devices connecting to the network.
- **Posture Assessment:**
    - Check devices for compliance (e.g., antivirus up-to-date) before granting access.
- **Guest Network Access:**
    - Provide restricted access for guest devices.

### **Advantages**

- **Enhanced Security:** Ensures only compliant devices access the network.
- **Visibility:** Provides insights into devices connected to the network.
