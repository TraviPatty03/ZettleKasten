### **Definition**

Dividing a network into smaller segments or subnets to improve security and performance by limiting access between them.

### **Ubuntu/Linux and Windows**

- **Use VLANs:**
    - Configure switches and routers to create Virtual Local Area Networks.
- **Set Up Subnets:**
    - Assign different IP address ranges to separate network segments.
- **Configure Firewall Rules:**
    - Control traffic between segments with strict firewall policies.
- **Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs):**
    - Define who can access what resources within and between segments.
- **Use Network Address Translation (NAT):**
    - Hide internal IP addresses from external networks.

### **Advantages**

- **Enhanced Security:** Limits the spread of malware and unauthorized access.
- **Improved Performance:** Reduces network congestion.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Complexity:** Requires advanced networking knowledge.
- **Cost:** May need additional hardware or software.
