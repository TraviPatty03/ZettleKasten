### Definition

**NAT** is a method used by routers to translate private IP addresses to a public IP address (and vice versa) for internet communication.

### Types of NAT

- **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between private and public IP addresses.
- **Dynamic NAT**: Uses a pool of public IP addresses and assigns them on demand.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Multiple private IPs share a single public IP using different ports.

### Benefits

- **IP Conservation**: Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.
- **Security**: Hides internal network structure from external entities.
