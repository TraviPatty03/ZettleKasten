### Definition

**Real-Time Constraints in Synchronization** refer to the requirements that synchronization mechanisms must meet to ensure timely and predictable task execution in real-time systems.

### Key Features

- **Latency**:
    - Synchronization operations must have minimal and predictable latency.
- **Non-Blocking Algorithms**:
    - Preferred to avoid delays caused by blocking locks.
- **Resource Management**:
    - Critical to prevent bottlenecks that can cause missed deadlines.
- **Determinism**:
    - Ensures that system behavior is predictable under all conditions.
- **Interrupt Handling**:
    - Synchronization primitives may need to be safe to use within interrupt service routines.

### Personal Insight

Designing synchronization for real-time systems is challenging but essential. It requires a deep understanding of both the hardware and software timing characteristics.
