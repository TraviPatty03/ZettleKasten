### **Definition**

**Offset Hooks** are specialized lock picks that combine the reach of deeper hooks with the maneuverability of shorter hooks through a gradual extension or curve in their design.

### **Characteristics**

- **Curved Tip:** Allows for rotation and pivoting around pin stacks.
- **Balanced Profile:** Minimizes bulk while extending reach.

### **Advantages**

- **Versatile Use:** Effective in both single pin picking and difficult pin configurations.
- **Enhanced Maneuverability:** Can navigate around pins without disturbing them.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Fragility:** More complex shapes can be prone to breaking.
- **Specific Use Cases:** May not perform well in very tight or rusted locks.
