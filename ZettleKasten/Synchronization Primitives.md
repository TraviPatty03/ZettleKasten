### Definition

**Synchronization Primitives** are basic building blocks used to control the order of execution in concurrent programming, ensuring correct sequencing and data integrity when multiple threads or processes access shared resources.

### Key Features

- **Types**:
    - **Mutexes**: For mutual exclusion.
    - **Semaphores**: For signaling and controlling access counts.
    - **Monitors**: High-level synchronization constructs.
    - **Barriers**: Synchronize threads at certain points.
- **Functions**:
    - Coordinate thread execution.
    - Prevent race conditions.
- **Implementation**:
    - Provided by programming languages or operating systems.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Protecting critical sections.
    - Implementing complex synchronization patterns.

### Personal Insight

Choosing the appropriate synchronization primitive is vital for achieving both correctness and performance in concurrent applications.
