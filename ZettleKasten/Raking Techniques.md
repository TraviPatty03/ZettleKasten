- **Speed-Oriented:** Focuses on quick pin setting rather than precision.

### **Advantages**

- **Efficiency:** Can open locks faster than single pin picking.
- **Simplicity:** Easier to learn for beginners compared to SPP.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Less Control:** Higher chance of oversetting or missing pins.
- **Limited Effectiveness:** Struggles with high-security locks and security pins.
