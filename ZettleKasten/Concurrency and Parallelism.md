### Definition

**Concurrency** and **Parallelism** are concepts in computing that describe the execution of multiple tasks.

- **Concurrency** refers to the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks by interleaving their execution.
- **Parallelism** involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously, usually leveraging multiple processors or cores.

### Key Features

- **Concurrency**:
    - Task switching managed by the scheduler.
    - Improves system responsiveness.
- **Parallelism**:
    - Simultaneous task execution.
    - Requires hardware with multiple processing units.
- **Interrelation**:
    - Concurrency is a programming design, while parallelism is about hardware capabilities.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Handling multiple user requests.
    - Performing I/O operations while processing data.

### Personal Insight

Understanding the difference between concurrency and parallelism is crucial for designing efficient systems. Concurrency improves program structure and responsiveness, while parallelism enhances performance by utilizing hardware capabilities.
