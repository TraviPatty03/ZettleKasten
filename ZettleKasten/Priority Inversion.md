### Definition

**Priority Inversion** occurs when a lower-priority thread holds a resource needed by a higher-priority thread, causing the higher-priority thread to wait, which can lead to missed deadlines in real-time systems.

### Key Features

- **Impact on RTOS**:
    - Can cause critical tasks to miss deadlines.
    - Affects system predictability.
- **Causes**:
    - Use of mutexes without priority inheritance.
    - Lack of proper synchronization protocols.
- **Solutions**:
    - **Priority Inheritance**:
        - Temporarily elevates the priority of the lower-priority thread holding the resource.
    - **Priority Ceiling Protocol**:
        - Assigns the highest priority to critical sections.
- **Examples**:
    - Mars Pathfinder mission experienced a priority inversion issue resolved by priority inheritance.

### Personal Insight

Priority inversion highlights the complexities of real-time synchronization. Implementing appropriate protocols is essential for system reliability.
