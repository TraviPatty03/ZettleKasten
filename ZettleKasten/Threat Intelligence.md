### Definition

**Threat Intelligence** is the collection and analysis of information about potential or current attacks that threaten an organization. It involves understanding adversaries' capabilities, motives, and attack methods to inform defensive strategies.

### Types of Threat Intelligence

- **Strategic**:
    - High-level information on changing risks; informs policies.
- **Tactical**:
    - Details on adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **Operational**:
    - Specific insights into cyberattacks, often in real-time.
- **Technical**:
    - Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) like IP addresses, malware hashes.

### Sources

- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**:
    - Publicly available information from websites, forums, social media.
- **Internal Data**:
    - Logs, incident reports, and security tools within the organization.
- **Information Sharing Communities**:
    - Industry groups like ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers).
- **Commercial Feeds**:
    - Subscription-based services providing curated intelligence.

### Benefits

- **Proactive Defense**:
    - Anticipate and prepare for potential threats.
- **Improved Response**:
    - Faster and more effective reaction to incidents.
- **Risk Management**:
    - Informed decision-making regarding security investments.
- **Awareness**:
    - Understanding the threat landscape and emerging trends.

### Challenges

- **Data Overload**:
    - Filtering relevant information from vast amounts of data.
- **Timeliness**:
    - Ensuring intelligence is up-to-date and actionable.
- **Integration**:
    - Incorporating intelligence into existing security processes.
- **Accuracy**:
    - Validating the credibility of sources.
