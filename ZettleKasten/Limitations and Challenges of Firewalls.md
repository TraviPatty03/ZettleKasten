- **Internal Threats**: Firewalls primarily protect against external attacks.
- **Encrypted Traffic**: Difficulty inspecting SSL/TLS encrypted data without proper configuration.
- **Advanced Threats**: May not detect sophisticated attacks like zero-day exploits.

### **Challenges**

- **Complex Configurations**: Misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: High traffic can impact firewall performance.
- **Evolving Threat Landscape**: Requires constant updates and monitoring.
