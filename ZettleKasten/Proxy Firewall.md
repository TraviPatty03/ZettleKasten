### **Definition**

A **Proxy Firewall**, also known as an Application-Level Gateway, acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers, filtering traffic at the application layer.

### **Characteristics**

- **OSI Layer**: Operates at the Application Layer (Layer 7).
- **Content Inspection**: Examines the data within the packets.
- **Anonymity**: Hides internal network addresses from the external network.

### **Advantages**

- **Deep Security**: Can detect and block specific content and applications.
- **User Authentication**: Supports user-level security policies.

### **Disadvantages**

- **Performance Overhead**: Slower than lower-layer firewalls due to intensive processing.
- **Scalability Issues**: May not be suitable for high-traffic networks.
