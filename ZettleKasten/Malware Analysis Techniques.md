### Definition

**Malware Analysis Techniques** are methods used to dissect and understand the behavior and purpose of malicious software. These techniques help in identifying malware capabilities and developing countermeasures.

### Techniques

#### Static Analysis

- **Disassembly**: Convert binaries to assembly code.
- **Hashing**: Generate file hashes for identification.
- **Signature Scanning**: Detect known malware patterns.
- **Metadata Examination**: Analyze file headers and properties.

#### Dynamic Analysis

- **Sandbox Execution**: Run malware in isolated environments.
- **System Monitoring**: Observe changes to files, registry, and processes.
- **Network Analysis**: Capture network traffic generated by malware.
- **Debugging**: Step through code execution.

#### Memory Analysis

- **Live Memory Inspection**: Analyze running processes and memory artifacts.
- **Dump Analysis**: Investigate memory dumps for hidden code.

#### Reverse Engineering

- **Decompilation**: Translate binaries into high-level code.
- **Code Flow Analysis**: Map out execution paths.
- **Obfuscation Handling**: Decode obfuscated or encrypted code.

### Tools Used

- **Static Analysis**: IDA Pro, Ghidra.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Process Monitor, Wireshark.
- **Memory Analysis**: Volatility Framework.
- **Sandboxing**: Cuckoo Sandbox.

### Security Considerations

- **Isolation**: Prevent malware from affecting real systems.
- **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Ensure analysis is lawful and ethical.
- **Data Protection**: Safeguard any sensitive information encountered.

### Personal Insight

**A multi-faceted approach using various techniques provides a deeper understanding of malware**, enhancing the effectiveness of defense strategies.
