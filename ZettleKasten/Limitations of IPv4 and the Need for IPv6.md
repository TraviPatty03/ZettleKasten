### IPv4 Limitations

- **Address Exhaustion**: Insufficient addresses for all devices.
- **Security**: Lacks built-in encryption features.
- **Performance**: Increased routing tables can slow down processing.

### Why IPv6?

- **Expanded Address Space**: Vast number of addresses.
- **Improved Security**: Mandatory support for IPsec.
- **Simplified Header**: Streamlines packet processing.

### Transition Considerations

- **Compatibility**: IPv4 and IPv6 are not directly compatible.
- **Adoption**: Gradual implementation across networks.
