This section will introduce you to these concepts, preparing you for the detailed notes that follow.

## 1. High Availability (HA)

- **Definition**: A system's ability to operate continuously without failing for a designated period.
- **Metrics**:
    - **Uptime Percentage**: Often expressed in "nines" (e.g., 99.999% uptime).
    - **Downtime Allowance**: The permissible amount of downtime over a specific period.

**Why It's Important**: High availability is critical for mission-critical applications where downtime can lead to significant revenue loss or operational issues.

## 2. Downtime and Zero Downtime

- **Downtime**: The period when a system is unavailable or not operational.
- **Zero Downtime**: A state where applications experience no service interruptions, even during maintenance or upgrades.

**Why It's Important**: In today's digital economy, even minimal downtime can impact user experience and business operations.

## 3. Cloud-Native Applications

- **Definition**: Applications designed specifically to run in a cloud computing environment, leveraging cloud features like scalability and distributed computing.

# Additional Notes from slides

## High Availability Principles and Mechanisms (Additional Details)

### Redundancy Models

Understanding different redundancy models is crucial for designing highly available systems. The slides introduce several redundancy configurations that provide varying levels of fault tolerance and resource efficiency.

#### 1. **2N Redundancy**

- **Configuration**: One active component and one standby component.
- **Purpose**: The standby component is a direct backup for the active one.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple and straightforward failover mechanism.
    - High reliability, as the standby is ready to take over immediately.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Doubles the required resources, leading to higher costs.
    - Standby resources may remain idle, not contributing to performance under normal conditions.

#### 2. **N+M Redundancy**

- **Configuration**: Multiple active components (N) with one or more standby components (M), where M is less than N.
- **Purpose**: Provides a pool of standby components that can replace any active component in case of failure.
- **Advantages**:
    - More resource-efficient than 2N redundancy.
    - Balances the need for reliability with cost considerations.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Complexity in managing which standby replaces a failed active component.
    - Potentially longer failover times compared to dedicated standby systems.

#### 3. **N-way Redundancy**

- **Configuration**: One active component and multiple standby components (X standbys).
- **Purpose**: Multiple standbys are ready to take over the role of the active component.
- **Advantages**:
    - Provides high fault tolerance with multiple backups.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Inefficient use of resources if all standbys remain idle.
    - Increased complexity in managing multiple standby components.

#### 4. **N-way-active Redundancy**

- **Configuration**: Multiple active components (X-active) working simultaneously.
- **Purpose**: All components actively share the workload.
- **Advantages**:
    - Efficient resource utilization, as all components contribute to performance.
    - Enhanced system throughput and load balancing.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Requires sophisticated synchronization and coordination mechanisms.
    - Complexity increases with the number of active components.

#### 5. **No Redundancy**

- **Configuration**: Only one active component with no standby.
- **Purpose**: Simplest form without any redundancy measures.
- **Advantages**:
    - Minimal resource requirements.
    - Lower operational costs.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - High risk of downtime if the active component fails.
    - Not suitable for systems requiring high availability.

### Redundancy Distribution

- **Geographic Redundancy**:
    - Distributes redundant components across different geographic locations.
    - Protects against regional failures, such as natural disasters or widespread network outages.
- **Cluster Redundancy**:
    - Groups components in clusters within the same data center or region.
    - Facilitates quick failover and load balancing within the cluster.

### Overload Protection Mechanisms

- **Autoscaling**:
    - Automatically adjusts the number of active instances based on real-time demand.
    - Ensures optimal resource utilization and maintains performance during traffic spikes.
- **Load Balancing**:
    - Evenly distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances.
    - Prevents any single component from becoming a bottleneck or point of failure.

### Recovery Actions

- **Failover/Switchover**:
    - Transitioning operations from a failed component to a standby component.
    - Can be automated for rapid recovery.
- **Restart**:
    - Rebooting or restarting a failed component to restore service.
- **Roll-back**:
    - Reverting to a previous stable state or version after detecting issues with a new deployment.
- **Roll-Forward**:
    - Applying fixes or updates to move beyond a failed state to a functional one.

### Integration with Application Architecture

- **Microservices and Stateless Design**:
    - Supports rapid scaling and redundancy.
    - Stateless services are easier to replicate and distribute across redundant components.
- **Modular Design and Clustered Architecture**:
    - Enhances maintainability and fault isolation.
    - Facilitates effective use of redundancy models and recovery mechanisms.

## Correction to the Service Availability Formula

### Incorrect Formula Presented in the Slides

The slides mistakenly present the formula for service availability as:

Service Availability=Service UptimeService Uptime×Service Outage\text{Service Availability} = \frac{\text{Service Uptime}}{\text{Service Uptime} \times \text{Service Outage}}Service Availability=Service Uptime×Service OutageService Uptime​

### Correct Formula for Service Availability

The accurate formula should be:

Service Availability=Service UptimeService Uptime+Service Outage\text{Service Availability} = \frac{\text{Service Uptime}}{\text{Service Uptime} + \text{Service Outage}}Service Availability=Service Uptime+Service OutageService Uptime​

- **Explanation**:
    - **Service Uptime**: The total duration when the system is operational.
    - **Service Outage**: The total duration when the system is unavailable.
    - The denominator represents the total time considered (Uptime + Outage).

### Importance of the Correct Formula

- **Accurate Measurement**:
    - Ensures precise calculation of availability percentages, critical for meeting SLAs.
- **Impact on High Availability Goals**:
    - Miscalculations can lead to underestimating downtime and overestimating system reliability.
- **Example with Five Nines (99.999%)**:
    - Permissible downtime is approximately 5 minutes and 16 seconds per year.
    - Correct calculations are essential to design systems that meet this stringent requirement.
