### Definition

**Tension Tools**, also known as tension wrenches or torsion wrenches, are essential tools in lockpicking that apply rotational force to a lock's plug, allowing pins to be set individually.

### Function

- **Applying Torque**:
    - Provides slight rotational pressure to the lock cylinder.
- **Feedback**:
    - Allows the picker to feel the binding of pins.
- **Control**:
    - Essential for setting pins at the shear line without oversetting.

### Types

- **Standard Tension Wrench**:
    - L-shaped tool inserted into the keyway's bottom or top.
- **Twist Flex Wrench**:
    - Has a twisted section for added flexibility.
- **Feather Touch Wrench**:
    - Designed for applying minimal tension, useful in delicate locks.
- **Double-Ended Wrench**:
    - Offers different widths or thicknesses on each end.

### Techniques

- **Bottom of Keyway (BOK)**:
    - Inserting the wrench at the bottom, leaving more room for picks.
- **Top of Keyway (TOK)**:
    - Provides better control in some lock designs.
- **Adjusting Tension**:
    - Varying pressure is critical; too much can bind pins, too little won't set them.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Legality**:
    - Possession and use of lockpicking tools are regulated in some regions.
- **Ethics**:
    - Should only be used on locks you own or have explicit permission to pick.

### Personal Insight

**Tension tools are the unsung heroes in the art of lockpicking**, requiring finesse and practice to master, and highlighting the intricate balance between mechanical design and security.
