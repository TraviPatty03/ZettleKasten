### **Definition**

Firewall policies are sets of rules that determine what traffic is allowed or blocked. These rules are essential for defining the security posture of a network.

### **Components**

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Define permissions based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
- **Rule Order**: The sequence in which rules are applied; often, the first matching rule is executed.
- **Default Action**: The action taken when no rules match (usually deny all or allow all).

### **Best Practices**

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only permit necessary traffic.
- **Regular Audits**: Review and update rules periodically.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of all policies and changes.
