### Structure

- **Format**: `x.x.x.x` where each `x` is an octet ranging from 0 to 255.
- **Bits**: Total of 32 bits (4 octets x 8 bits).

### Octets

- Each octet represents 8 bits.
- The division between **network** and **host** portions is determined by the subnet mask.

### Network vs. Host Portion

- **Network Portion**: Identifies the specific network.
- **Host Portion**: Identifies the specific device on that network.
